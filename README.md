# Multiple-DB-Server
Node server which gives dedicated database per user 

## Description
This project is a simple node server which will provide a **dedicated database** per single user. The idea behind this is to improve the
performance of the application by eradicating other users' records in the beginning and thereby we can directly connect to the requried
user's database directly.
